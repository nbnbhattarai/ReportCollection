\section{METHODOLOGY}

\subsection{Requirement Specification}
A software requirement specification is a description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements. It describes what the software product is expected to do and what not to do. It enlists enough and necessary requirements that are required for the project development. It mainly aids to describe the scope of the work and provide a software designers a form of reference.
\subsubsection{Functional Requirement}
The functional requirement specification of the project are mainly categorized as user requirements, security requirements, and device requirement each of which are explained in detail below:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Requirement: User should have account on Facebook and user must have at least one post needed to analyze the personality for the music recommendation.
\item Security Requirement: The user can't have access to the Facebook API. User must provide their own login credentials.
\item Device Requirement: System must be initiated on web-browser.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Non-functional Requirement}
The non-functional requirement of the system can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance: The system shall have a quick, accurate and reliable results.
\item Capacity and Scalability: The system shall be able to store personality computed by the system into the database.
\item Availability: The system shall be available to user anytime whenever there is an Internet connection.
\item Recovery: In case of malfunctioning or unavailability of server, the system should be able to recover and prevent any data loss or redundancy.
\item Flexibility and Portability: System shall be accessible anytime from any locations.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Feasibility Assessment}
Feasibility Assessment is done to analyze the viability of an idea. In case of software development, it performs the practicality of the project or system. The result from feasibility assessment determines whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or dropped. There are
five areas of feasibility - Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.

\subsubsection{Operational Feasibility}

The operational feasibility analysis gives the description about how the system operates and what resources do the system requires for performing its designated task. Being closely related to data analysis and integration, the system requires to be easily operable for different uses and operations like new data entry, concurrent use of system should be fluent consuming minimum cost and resources.
System to designed is operationally feasible as the system can be operated with the resource as of personal computer i.e browser. The project is developed as the website allows the easy access to the multiple  users. Beisdes the analysis task performed by the subsystem is also operationally feasible.

\subsubsection{Technical Feasibility}
Technical Feasibility Assessment examines whether the proposed system can actually be designed to solve the desired problems and requirements using available technologies in the given problem domain. The system is said to be feasible technically if it can be deployable, operable and manageable under current technological context of our country
Since the system aims to enhance the existing collaborative engines, via the use of personality and as the data set for the personality is avialable and the building a classifier is also feasible, the project can be considered technically feasible.

\subsubsection{Economic Feasibility}
Economic Feasibility checks whether the cost required for complete system development is feasible using at he available resources in hand. It should be noted that the cost of resources and overall cost of deployment of system should be kept minimum while operational and maintenance cost for the system should be within the capacity of organization.
Since the system is hosted on Heroku cloud hosting service which is free of cost for limited use, the system can be considered economically feasible for the developement.

\subsubsection{Legal Feasibility}
Legal Feasibility assessment checks the system for any conflicts with legal requirement, regulations that are to be followed as per the standard maintained by the governing body. As such, the system that is being developed must comply with all the legal boundaries such as copyright violation, authorize use of licenses and other. This prevent any future conflicts for the system and also provide legal basis for the system in future if any other tries to use part of or full system without necessary permission and documents. The data obtained from the social media of the user is being consented by the user and doesn't does violate any other obligation of law and privacy, project can be considered legally feasible.

\subsubsection{Scheduling Feasibility}
Any project is considered fail if it is not completed on time. so, Scheduling Feasibility estimates the time require fro the system to fully develop and whether that time feasible or not according to current trend in market. If the project takes longer time to complete, it may be outdated or some other may launch the similar system before our system is complete. So, it is required to fix the deadline for any project and the system should be out and operative before specified deadline. As the scheduling of the project is in consistent with the available time of the project, project can be considered scheduling feasibile.

\subsection{Software Development Approach}
The developed system, being huge and dynamic nature, may not be developed efficiently and timely procured with the traditional development approaches like waterfall. Thus to meet the requirements of the system and ensuring the timely delivery and adaptability for changing requirement, Scrum methodology under the Agile Development method is chosen for the development of system.

Scrum is an agile way to manage project. Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology, but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, it is often thought as a framework for managing a process. In the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project,much of it is left up to Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented. It relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. This is the issue that are decided by the team as a whole. Besides the team is cross functional, because of which everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.

This model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are time boxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks. It advocates for planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to and then create a sprint backlog, a list of task to perform during the sprint. During an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.

On each day of the sprint, all team members attend a Scrum meeting. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day and identify any impediments to progress. The model sees routine scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint. At the end of a sprint the sprint review is conducted, during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to any stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint. The feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.

The primary artifact in Scrum development is, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint. The product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The most popular and successful way to create a product backlog using Scrum methodology is to populated it with the user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer. In Scrum project management, on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting, team members create the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog can be thought of as the team's to do list for the sprint whereas the product backlog is a list of features to be built. The sprint backlog is the list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the functionality it committed to deliver during the sprint. Additional artifacts in the Scrum methodology is the sprint burn down chart which shows the amount of work remaining either in a sprint to determine whether a sprint is on schedule to have all planned work finished by the desired date.

Hence scrum is adaptive, has small repeating cycles and there is short-term planning with constant feedback, inspection and adaption and is therefore chosen as the software development methodology. Here, project team members can be thought of a software development team and project supervisor as scrum master. The scrum meeting was conducted regularly within the interval of 3 weeks, keeping scrum backlog as well as product backlog and hence the progress in the project was made in the form of sprints whereby the product backlog helped to identify and prioritizes the features to implement in each sprint and the burn down chart helped to keep the project timely on schedule. Whenever the bug was found relating to the feature, it was dealt immediately before marking the feature complete i.2 1-2 sprints ware focused only on Defect backlogs. Each scrum meeting lasted about 15 minutes in which every team member answered three question: What have I done since last meeting?, What will I do until next meeting? and What problems do I have? and hence in this way a cycle is continued till product is completely developed.


\subsection{Data Collection}
In order to predict the personality, dataset for training the classification model was obtained from myPersonality website\cite{dataset}. It consisted of collections of status updates of Facebook users along with their personality classification scores in terms of big five personality traits. For the recommendation system, survey was conducted among the colleagues who gave ratings to predefined set of music in the database. Their personality traits were determined with our personality classification model before they rated the music.

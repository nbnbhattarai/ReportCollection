Conclusion

In this project, we have developed a recommendation system that takes facebook user's profile imformation (status, posts and music likes) as input and 
recommend similar music to user on the basis of thier taste in music. the music recommendation is done analysing the facebook activity of the user on music data.
We first used dataset from myPersonality.org to train and model the system. Modeling is done by using natural language processing techniques. Classification od user's personalityimplemented
is done according to big five traits of personality. Later on, we used surveyed data to test our recommendation model and to calculate various performance metrics of the 
system

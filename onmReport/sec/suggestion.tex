\section{Suggestions/ Recommendations}
The suggestions/recommendations to improvise the organization are specified below:
\begin{itemize}
\item  There should have been a name board for proper identification of the organization.
\item
Both print and web media should be used for advertising events so that larger population could be
reached effectively.
\item If the priority are given to local clients and local projects, it can help develop various related sectors
within Nepal.
\item  There should be an easier way of taking leaves like forwarding the leave application to the higher level
all at once without redundancy.
\end{itemize}
